#### Messiest Desk Tracker
### Objective
###### The objective of this project is to develop a full-stack web application that allows users to log in and manage a personalized list of messy desks they have encountered. The application will serve as a platform to demonstrate core backend and frontend development concepts, including user authentication, CRUD operations, and data sorting.

### Tools and technologies
##### Backend:

Node.js and Express.js: For building the server-side API.
Mongoose: To interact with the MongoDB database.
JWT and bcrypt: For secure user authentication.
##### Frontend:

React.js: To create a user-friendly interface.
Vite: For fast setup and development.
##### Database:

MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-hosted NoSQL database.
##### Deployment:

Render: To host the backend.
Vercel/Netlify: For deploying the React frontend.
##### API Testing:

Postman: To test and debug API endpoints.
